I created and ran the Django app using PyCharm, so I would just hit run in PyCharm. Then, in my browser I would go to
'http://localhost:8000/index/' where a simple HTML page is displayed. Once this page is reached, go to
'http://localhost:8000/index/JSON/' to see the JSON response. The JSON response page will only be accessible after the
index page is visited, otherwise there will be an error and JSON response will not be shown.
